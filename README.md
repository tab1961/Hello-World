# Hello-World
CS-251 Statistics and Data Analysis
My name is Tony Butler and this semester, I'm taking two programming courses. Up until now, I haven't done any programming in over 20-years, I am both very nervous about this, and looking forward to it at the same time.
Commit message: I made a change to the readme file, that included a short message about myself.
